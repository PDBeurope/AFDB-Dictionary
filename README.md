# AFDB-Dictionary
This repository houses the mmcif_af dictionary supporting the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/).

The dictionary builds upon data categories collated from the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary (http://mmcif.wwpdb.org)
and the Model Archive (MA) dictionary (https://github.com/ihmwg/MA-dictionary).

As of V1, this is a self-contained dictionary and does not require any compilation.
